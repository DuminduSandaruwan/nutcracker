	 General tips for coming to the Memorial Service at Fort Logan:
	 <ul>
	 <li>Bring lawn chairs, maybe a blanket. They setup at least 1000 chairs for the audience but these fill fast.
	 <li>Arrive early. We go and arrive between 8:30-9am. This allows us to park close to the service. We bring food and drink
	 and use the early arrival to allow us to walk through the gravestones and read the stories there.
	 <li>Bring sunscreen, there will be lots of sun.
	 </ul>
